Archived. We are not currently using this data service.

This service was part of our data hubâ€“a large internal project to consolidate data across many disparate systems at the Art Institute of Chicago into a single, unified source. This offers our products a rich set of data that can be accessed in one way, in one location.

For more information about our data hub, please see the following paper:
